<h2>INGREDEANTS</h2>
<body>225 grams
Plain Flour
350 grams
Caster Sugar
85 grams
Cocoa Powder
1 ½ teaspoons
Baking Powder
1 ½ teaspoons
Bicarbonate Of Soda
2 
Free-Range Eggs
250 milliliters
Milk
125 milliliters
Vegetable Oil
2 teaspoons
Vanilla Extract
250 milliliters
Boiling Water
200 grams
Plain Chocolate  (broken into pieces)
200 milliliters
Double Cream
<H2>METHOD</H2>
   
Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease and line two 20cm/8in sandwich tins.

To make the cake, place all of the cake ingredients, except the boiling water, into a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon, or electric whisk, beat the mixture until smooth and well combined.

Add the boiling water to the mixture, a little at a time, until smooth. (The cake mixture will now be very liquid.)

Divide the cake batter between the sandwich tins and bake in the oven for 25–35 minutes, or until the top is firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.

Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to cool completely, still in their tins, before icing.

To make the chocolate ganache, heat the chocolate and cream in a saucepan over a low heat until the chocolate melts. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk the mixture until smooth, glossy and thickened. Set aside to cool for 1–2 hours, or until thick enough to spread over the cake.

To assemble the cake, run a round-bladed knife around the inside of the cake tins to loosen the cakes. Carefully remove the cakes from the tins.

Spread a little chocolate ganache over the top of one of the chocolate cakes, then carefully top with the other cake.

Transfer the cake to a serving plate and ice the cake all over with the chocolate ganache, using a palette knife.
<H2>Recipe tips</H2>
    The chocolate cake mixture is quite runny, so it's important to use sandwich tins rather than springform tins, which could leak.

You don't have to cover the cake in ganache, you can also use chocolate buttercream.

Which chocolate cake is the best?

It depends on personal preference! This recipe is an easy, moist cake that keeps well (great when you don’t want to be cooking at the last minute).

Our best chocolate cakes collection has all types of chocolate cake covered, including gluten-free and vegan options, light spongy cakes and rich deeply-chocolatey cakes.

Why is my chocolate cake dry and crumbly?

You might have added too much cocoa powder, which absorbs more moisture than flour. Only add the amount suggested in the recipe: don’t be tempted to add extra thinking it will make your cake more chocolatey, it’s more likely to make it dry and crumbly. The other option is that your cake has been overcooked which will dry it out.

How do I stop my cake from cracking and doming?

Ovens do vary and if yours runs hot you might find your cakes are very domed with deep cracks on the top. Try lowering the temperature a little.

Does refrigerating cake dry it out?

Yes, fridges are a dry environment which will draw moisture from a cake making it stale before its time, so do not put sponge cakes in the fridge in an attempt to make them last longer.

The exception to this is when a cake is filled with fresh cream (or anything else that needs to be kept cold) when you should fill it at the last minute to minimise time in the fridge. Also, if it’s a hot day you might need to chill a cake to prevent the icing melting.

If a cake is completely covered with buttercream this will form a protective layer which helps prevent the cake drying out in the fridge. However the cold can still affect the texture of the sponge (as the fats in the cake solidify) so it should be brought back to room temperature before serving.

<h2>INGREDEANTS</h2>
½ cup
Granulated Sugar
¾ cup
Brown Sugar  (packed)
1 teaspoon
Salt
½ cup
Unsalted Butter  (melted)
1 
Large Egg
1 teaspoon
Vanilla Extract
1 ¼ cups
All-Purpose Flour
½ teaspoon
Baking Soda
4 ounces
Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks  (or milk)
4 ounces
Dark Chocolate Chunk  (or your preference)
<h2>METHOD</h2>
In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).
Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.
Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.
Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the edges have started to barely brown.
Cool completely before serving.
Enjoy!

<h1>Easy Pizza Crust Recipe</h1>
<img src="https://cookiesandcups.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pizzadoughimages-10-1024x1536.jpg" alt="">
<h2>INGREDEANTS</h2>
2 ¼ cups
All-Purpose Flour
1 envelope
Fleischmann's Rapidrise Yeast
1 ½ teaspoons
Granulated Sugar
1 teaspoon
Kosher Salt
⅔ cup
Warm Water (120 ° to 130 ° F)
3 tablespoons
Olive Oil
1 cup
Pizza Sauce
2 cups
Mozzarella Cheese (shredded)
1 cup
Pepperoni (sliced, or preferred topping)
2 tablespoons
Cornmeal (if using a pizza stone)
<h2>For making the pizza and toppings</h2>
Extra virgin olive oil
Cornmeal (to help slide the pizza onto the pizza stone)
Tomato sauce (smooth or pureed)
Firm mozzarella cheese, grated
Fresh soft mozzarella cheese, separated into small clumps
Fontina cheese, grated
Parmesan cheese, grated
Feta cheese, crumbled
Mushrooms, very thinly sliced if raw, otherwise first sautéed
Bell peppers, stems and seeds removed, very thinly sliced
Italian pepperoncini, thinly sliced
Italian sausage, cooked ahead and crumbled
Sliced black olives
Chopped fresh basil
Baby arugula, tossed in a little olive oil, added as pizza comes out of the oven
<h2>Making the Pizza Dough</h2>
Proof the yeast:
Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.

After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.

(Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)
<h2>Make and knead the pizza dough:</h2>
Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.

Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7 to 10 minutes.

If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.

The dough should be a little sticky or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.
<h2>Let the dough rise:</h2>
Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.

At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.

Cover the dough with plastic wrap.

For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours.

For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours).

The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.
<h2>Preparing the Pizzas</h2>
<h2>Preheat the pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet):</h2>
Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures.
<h2>Divide the dough into 2 balls:</h2>
Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half.

Form 2 round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic, and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).
<h2>Prep the toppings:</h2>
Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way.

About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza. One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza.
<h2>Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round:</h2>
Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface.

Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.

Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter—10 to 12 inches.

Treat the dough gently!

You can also hold up the edges of the dough with your fingers, letting the dough hang and stretch, while working around the edges of the dough.

If a hole appears in your dough, place the dough on a floured surface and push the dough back together to seal the hole.

Use your palm to flatten the edge of the dough where it is thicker. Pinch the edges if you want to form a lip.
<h2>Brush the dough top with olive oil</h2>
Use your fingertips to press down and make dents along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings). Let rest another 10 to 15 minutes.

Repeat with the second ball of dough.
<h2>Sprinkle the pizza peel with cornmeal, put flattened dough on top:</h2>
Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with cornmeal. (The cornmeal will act as little ball bearings to help move the pizza from the pizza peel into the oven.)

Transfer one prepared flattened dough to the pizza peel.

If the dough has lost its shape in the transfer, lightly shape it to the desired dimensions.
<h2>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings:</h2>
Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy
<h2>Slide pizza into the oven:</h2>
Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (watch your hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide; if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more cornmeal.

Slide the pizza off the peel and onto the baking stone in the oven.

<h2>Bake:</h2>
Bake pizza in the 475°F oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time, you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.
